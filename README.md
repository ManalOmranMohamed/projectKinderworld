# Kinder World

Kinder World is a multi-role educational and parental-control platform built with Flutter and FastAPI.

This README reflects the current codebase, not legacy docs.

## Overview

The repository contains:

- `kinderbackend/`: FastAPI backend with SQLAlchemy models, service-layer logic, and `pytest` tests
- `kinder_world_child_mode/`: Flutter client with Riverpod, GoRouter, local storage, and widget/unit tests
- `.github/workflows/`: backend and Flutter CI

Main user contexts:

- `Parent`: manages children, views reports, uses parental controls, handles support, and manages paid access
- `Child`: signs in with a picture-password flow and uses the child learning/play experience
- `Admin`: uses a separate auth system and RBAC-protected management surfaces

## Current Product Flows

### Parent

- Parent registration, login, refresh, logout
- Parent profile update and password change
- Parent PIN setup, verification, change, and reset request
- Child profile creation, update, listing, and deletion
- Parent dashboard, reports, notifications, privacy settings, and parental controls
- Support ticket creation, history, detail, and replies
- One-time purchase flow with provider checkout and lifetime premium entitlement

### Child

- Child registration and login endpoints
- Picture-password-based child authentication
- Child session validation
- Child change-password flow
- Child home, learn, play, AI buddy, profile, achievements, and store routes
- Child home presentation surfaces prefer real data and hide unsupported sections instead of showing placeholder cards

### Admin

- Dedicated admin login, refresh, logout, and profile retrieval
- RBAC-protected admin routes
- Admin user, child, analytics, audit, support, content, subscription, and settings management

### Reports

- Parent reports include KPIs, trends, sessions, and short interpretation cards
- Insights are intentionally evidence-backed and weak-signal insights are hidden when data is too thin

## Payments

The current paid-access model is:

- `one-time purchase`
- `lifetime access`

Parent-facing recurring semantics are intentionally disabled in the main flow:

- `POST /subscription/cancel` returns `410`
- `POST /subscription/manage` returns `410`
- `POST /billing/portal` returns `410`

Backend plan metadata currently exposes:

- `billing_type = one_time`
- `access_type = lifetime` for paid plans

The Flutter purchase UI is aligned to this model and avoids parent-facing monthly or renewal language in the presentation flow.

## Architecture Summary

### Backend

Practical layered structure:

- `routers/`: HTTP endpoints and request wiring
- `services/`: domain and business logic
- `schemas/`: Pydantic request/response models
- `models.py` and `admin_models.py`: SQLAlchemy models
- `deps.py` and `admin_deps.py`: auth, RBAC, and database dependencies
- `core/`: settings, logging, exception handling, validators, security helpers

Notable backend modules:

- `services/auth_service.py`: parent auth, profile, password, parent PIN
- `services/child_service.py`: child registration/login/session/password and child profile operations
- `services/support_ticket_service.py`: parent/admin support flows
- `services/admin_auth_service.py`: admin auth and security logic
- `services/subscription_service.py`: one-time purchase state, entitlement unlock, refunds, and plan selection logic
- `services/analytics_service.py`: analytics ingestion and report construction

### Frontend

The Flutter app uses:

- `Riverpod` for state and dependency injection
- `GoRouter` for navigation and access guards
- `Hive` for local persistence
- `SharedPreferences` for lightweight persisted flags
- `SecureStorage` for auth and session data

Main frontend areas:

- `features/app_core`
- `features/auth`
- `features/child_mode`
- `features/parent_mode`
- `features/admin`
- `features/system_pages`

Current presentation-focused behavior:

- Parent reports use short interpretation instead of raw metrics only
- Child home hides unsupported cards instead of showing misleading placeholders
- Purchase screens present one-time purchase and lifetime access only

- support
- subscriptions and paid access
- parent/child flows
- presentation-focused smoke flows

Useful commands:

```bash
cd kinderbackend
python -m pytest -q
python -m mypy
python -m pytest -q --cov=. --cov-fail-under=70 --cov-report=term-missing:skip-covered
```

The current presentation smoke file is:

- `kinderbackend/test_presentation_smoke_flows.py`

It covers:

- parent login
- child login
- child activity flow
- parent reports
- admin login
- one-time purchase success
- premium entitlement unlock

### Flutter

Flutter tests live under `kinder_world_child_mode/test/` and include:

- unit tests
- repository and session tests
- widget tests
- routing and startup tests
- admin, parent, and child flow tests
- focused presentation smoke tests for the core demo journeys

Useful commands:

```bash
cd kinder_world_child_mode
flutter analyze
flutter test
flutter test --coverage
```

The current presentation smoke file is:

- `kinder_world_child_mode/test/presentation_smoke_test.dart`

It covers:

- parent login
- child login
- child activity flow
- parent reports
- admin login
- one-time purchase success
- premium entitlement unlock

- `PROD_API_BASE_URL`

## Current Status / Known Limitations

These points are based on the current codebase behavior:

- Backend test coverage is stronger than the full Flutter test surface.
- Flutter API configuration is environment-driven, but staging and production still require explicit `--dart-define` values.
- Parent-facing paid access is one-time purchase with lifetime entitlement.
- Recurring parent billing semantics are intentionally disabled in the current parent flow.
- Some billing lifecycle fields still exist in backend and admin models for compatibility.
- Some content, legal, and help endpoints are still static data rather than a full managed CMS flow.
- Some premium and family features still rely on simplified or demo-style payloads instead of deep external integrations:
  - AI insights
  - offline downloads
  - priority support metadata
- Coverage gates are intentionally conservative today:
  - backend source coverage floor is `70%`
  - Flutter non-generated coverage floor is `28%`

## Future Improvements

Reasonable next improvements based on the current code structure:

- raise coverage thresholds gradually
- continue cleaning legacy recurring-payment compatibility fields after the one-time purchase migration
- replace placeholder or static legal/help content where needed
- continue extracting complex Flutter UI and state logic into smaller units
- expand backend coverage into weaker admin, content, and data-lifecycle areas
- expand Flutter coverage for repositories, reports, and route-dependent flows

## Notes

This README is a technical status document for contributors, reviewers, and academic evaluation. It intentionally reflects unfinished areas that still exist in the code.
